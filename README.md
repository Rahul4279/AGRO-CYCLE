🌱 Excited to share our PBL Project on Crop Yield Prediction at GM University, Davanagere! 🚀

Our project focuses on leveraging Machine Learning to solve one of the most pressing challenges in agriculture – accurate crop yield prediction. By analyzing factors like weather conditions, soil nutrients (N, P, K, pH), and past yield data, we built models that help farmers make informed decisions.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Implemented Linear Regression and Neural Network models using Python, Pandas & Scikit-learn

Achieved an R² score of 0.78 with Linear Regression as the best-performing model

Identified rainfall and soil pH as the most influential features

Proposed future integration with IoT sensors, satellite monitoring, and mobile apps for real-time predictions

💡 Takeaway: Data-driven agriculture can play a key role in ensuring food security and sustainable farming.

A big thanks to our guide Mrs. Shivaranjini S S and my amazing teammates Ashish Rout, Jayadeva M R, and Rahul R Gadgimata for making this project a success. 🙌
